# First JS Project

As instructed in the Odin Project curriculum,
I will build a rock, paper scissors game that
runs in the console exclusively.

For this project I will apply the 
problem solving skills I have learned
and will plan carefully before trying 
to implement any code, then debug it if a problem arises!

The graphical interface w/ icons will be added later
on, when I get further into the curriculum.
