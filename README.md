## RPS w/ GUI

Finally finished the game, there's a lot of stuff
to fix & improve (especially the fact that even if you win or
lose you have to click once more for the result
to be displayed)

It took me ages to figure out how to make the game
unplayable after it was over, because I couldn't 
initialize event listeners in a loop, so that's
something I gotta learn a lot more about.
