# First JS Project (RPS)

As instructed in the Odin Project curriculum,
I will build a rock, paper scissors game that
runs in the console exclusively.

For this project I will apply the 
problem solving skills I have learned
and will plan carefully before trying 
to implement any code, then debug it if a problem arises!

The graphical interface w/ icons will be added later
on, when I get further into the curriculum.

## Update

Now the game's working well and I have made
some improvements, after reading other people's
code I found out various ways to improve the program
and am understanding the reasoning behind them
and implementing similar structures progressively.
